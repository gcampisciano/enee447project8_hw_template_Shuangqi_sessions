    \param io This is boolean value that indicates whether the

            for memmory-mapped IO. 
    
            If io == 1, you can initalize TEX, C, and B bits to 
                make the entry a "Non-shareable Device".

            If io == 1, you can initalize TEX, C, and B bits to 
                make the entry a "Cacheable memory".

    \param global This is a boolean value that indicates whether
            this virtual-to-physical mapping belongs to all threads.

            You should initialize the nG bit accordingly.

    /*  Needs implementation: initialize system registers to set up VM 
        
        With the help of official ARM doc, you need to initialize the following 
            system registers:

            - CONTEXTIDR and TTBR0
                - Have a look at irq_handler to figure out why we want to
                    initialize these two registers here
                - The idea is that once we start VM, the kernel will be the first
                    program to be running in it. So we need to set up kernel's
                    VM context here.
                - NOTE: when you assign a value to TTBR0, you should
                    OR it with 0x4a just like we did in create_thread()
            - TTBCR 
                - 32-bit translation system with short-descrptor format is used
                - only TTBR0 is used ( TTBR1 is not used)
                - NOTE: if you don't want to intialize other bits of the register,
                    just levave them as they are.
            - DACR
                - Since in this project we don't make use of permission bits,
                    you can intialize all domains to be manager mode
            - SCTLR
                - disable TEX remap
                - enable MMU
